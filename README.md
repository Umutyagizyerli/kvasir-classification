# Kvasir Dataset Classification Project

This project focuses on image classification using the Kvasir dataset, which contains endoscopic images categorized into different gastrointestinal classes. The goal is to classify images into 8 categories.

## Models Used

* MobileNet – Lightweight CNN optimized for mobile and embedded devices.

* VGG16 – Deep CNN architecture widely used for image classification tasks.

* Custom CNN Model – A sequential CNN model with multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. 

# Dataset

The Kvasir dataset contains endoscopic images of the gastrointestinal tract.

Images are resized to 224x224 pixels for model input.

Dataset is split into training and validation sets.
